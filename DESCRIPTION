Description: Fitting (non-)hierarchical bayesian ordinal models with ordered thresholds, including
    Normal Signal Detection Theory (SDT), Unequal Variance Normal SDT, meta-d', and general ordinal models.
    The parameters (mean, d', thresholds, sd ratio) are derived from unconstrained parameters via link
    functions (including the order-preserving link functions for the thresholds), allowing the original
    parameters to be linearly regressed on additional variables.
